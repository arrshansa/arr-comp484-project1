                    <h2>Christopher Nolan</h2>
                    <p class="director-title">Writer & Director</p>
                    <p>
                        Christopher Nolan is a British-American filmmaker known for his complex nonlinear narratives that are at times so confusing that many people never understand his movies but still enjoy watching them. And this guy is one of my most if not my my most favorite movie director to ever exist! His movies and especially Interstellar is one of the biggest factors in shaping my love for cinema and taste for it. From the very moment, I watched this movie for the first time Interstellar was his most scientifically ambitious project, developed in close collaboration with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne. Despite it being super gradeur in terms of subject and visual spectacle, the rather grounded emotion between a father and daughter is what made the movie as special as it is.

                    <p>
                        His previous films include <em>The Dark Knight Trilogy</em>, <em>Inception</em>, and <em>Memento</em>. With Interstellar, he pushed the boundaries of practical filmmaking and continued his use of real IMAX cameras (which was also used in The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises).
